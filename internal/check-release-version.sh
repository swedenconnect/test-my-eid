# Checks that the project may be published under a given release tag.
#
# The tag must be "v" followed by the version in the POMs, and that version must not be a snapshot.
# Every module that is actually deployed is checked, not only the root, so a module left behind at
# an older parent version stops the release before anything is uploaded. Test my eID is a single
# module today, so this is the root POM alone, but a module added later is checked without changes
# here. A module that sets maven.deploy.skip is not published, and is not checked.
#
# Usage:
#     internal/check-release-version.sh <tag> [<modules-file>]
#
# <modules-file> exists for the tests. It replaces the interrogation of the POMs with pre-computed
# lines of "<pom path> <version> <deploy skip>". Without it the versions are read from the POMs
# with the Maven help plugin.
#
# Exit status: 0 when the release may go ahead, 1 when it must not, 2 on a usage error.
