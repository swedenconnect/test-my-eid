# another one, sets that version in every pom.xml, builds the project, commits, pushes the branch,
# tags the release commit and pushes the tag. Merging the branch into master is left to you, and the
# next snapshot version is opened afterwards with internal/post-release-bump.sh, run on master.

# Pushing the tag is what starts publishing, so the script asks before it does that. Publishing to
# Maven Central and of the Docker image is done by GitHub workflows when the tag is pushed, see
